Do a brain dump about how we planned CRISM project. With CS we didn't do it, so we made a great progress on this in a year.

# Planning the new analyses

## Nathan TODO:
Describe the process of preparing an issue. Chat with Vitaly, take notes about what we want to do. Then create an issue based on the notes. Vitaly looks at the issue and edits/comments if needed. You plan the scripts (how do you do that, btw, Nathan, I have no idea). T

# Having Vitaly sign off on the analyses
How does Vitaly sign off the code. Sharing screen while vitaly looks at logs and diffs. Cover pull requests (or just link the git resources again)


# Preparing the paper

## Latex 
Cover latex options here. Texmaker, overleaf. Overleaf ideal, but can't always be used based on data.  Crucially, cover how we save files and load them in latex. Let's add our templates

# Editing
Discuss (briefly) how we talk to other economists and iterate on their feedback.
