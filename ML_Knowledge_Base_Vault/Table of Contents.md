# [[Planning a Project]]
- [[Creating a Coding Pipeline]]

## Nathan TODO

Do a brain dump about how we planned CRISM project. With CS we didn't do it, so we made a great progress on this in a year.

# Starting a new project or managing an existing one in Git

- new project in [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/)
- new project in [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/creating-a-project-board)

#### renv

- see [[renv]] for more information about the package

## Nathan TODO: 
Put the below into a separate file and reference it here

### [[Setting up a Project with Renv]]

## Nathan TODO: Make the below more descriptive by adding examples at every step. Example of notes of what V says during meeting, example of a todo N makes based on the notes, example of issue. 

# [[Planning New Analyses]]


Describe the process of preparing an issue. Chat with Vitaly, take notes about what we want to do. Then create an issue based on the notes. Vitaly looks at the issue and edits/comments if needed. You plan the scripts (how do you do that, btw, Nathan, I have no idea). T


### [[Branch and Issue Workflow]]

## Nathan TODO:
Make the same thing as "Starting a new project" just for quick steps to pull the branch of interest

# Nathan TODO: 
Add discussion of keeping data files separate by time and/or some unit identifiers when the dataset is large.

### [[Quick Steps for Pushing to a Branch]]

## Research Practices

# Nathan TODO for reasoning:
Can you add to the reasoning thing below an actionable check list? For example:




# Executing the analyses: writing new scripts or editing existing ones


#### writing code
## NATHAN TODO: discuss git add and git push, put this in a separate note and link it both here and above in the new "pushing and pulling using git" section

# [[Having Vitaly sign off on the analyses]]
How does Vitaly sign off the code. Sharing screen while vitaly looks at logs and diffs. Cover pull requests (or just link the git resources again)

# Preparing the paper

## LaTeX 
Cover latex options here. Texmaker, overleaf. Overleaf ideal, but can't always be used based on data.  Crucially, cover how we save files and load them in latex. Let's add our templates

- tables and figures should be created programatically in code
	- use [[kableExtra]] for generating `.tex` files
	- use [[ggplot]] for generating the `.png` output

# Editing
Discuss (briefly) how we talk to other economists and iterate on their feedback.
