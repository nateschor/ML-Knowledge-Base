The R package [shrtcts](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/shrtcts/) provides a way for users to create and manage custom keyboard shortcuts in RStudio by defining R functions as shortcuts. The package allows users to store their shortcuts in a configuration file, which can be located in either `~/.config/.shrtcts.R` or `~/.shrtcts.R`. The package also provides a way to add the defined shortcuts to the RStudio Addins menu or assign keyboard shortcuts to them.
