-   When a collaborator first launches in the project, `renv` should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of renv into the project library. After this has completed, they can then use [renv::restore()](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) to restore the project library locally on their machine
