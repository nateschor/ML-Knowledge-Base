1. Create a branch that is linked to the issue. For example, if the GitHub/GitLab assigned number to the issue Create outcome variable for defaulting is 4, the name of the branch should be issue4_create_outcome_variable_for_defaulting
2. `git pull` to make your local setup synced with the repo, and then `git switch issue4_create_outcome_variable_for_defaulting` to switch to the new branch
3. Write code, committing and pushing as you make changes
	1. make sure all of your commit messages on these branch include `#4`, so that when you push the commit message and associated changes show up in the issue
	2. if you want to write a longer message, use `git commit`. It will then open up a [[vim]] editor for your commit message
