1. thought about what aspects of previous projects we wanted to improve on
	- folder structure
		- folder structure led to our use of [[here]] for file paths, creating an `.RProject` at the root of the repo, and thinking about what kind of folders we would need [[Creating a Coding Pipeline#Automate Folder Generation]]
	- how we do Pull Requests
		- thinking about improving Pull Requests led to googling where [[tidylog]] was discovered, and we paired it with [[logr]] for review during pull requests
2. created the folder structure and wrote skeleton code for the pipeline script
	- We also thought about what kind of tasks needed to be completed and how to logically break them up into multiple scripts, and what the main pipeline script should look like (see [[Creating a Coding Pipeline#Separating Code into Multiple Scripts]])
3. determined what code could be reused
	- thinking about how this project would be different from CS made us realize that we'd have fewer variables in the model and that we should explore the data more, leading to us using/discovering the packages in [[EDA]]
