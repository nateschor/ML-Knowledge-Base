The output for most code is either datasets, models, plots, or tables. If it takes a long time (more than 10 minutes) for the code to run, save the code output so that you do not need to constantly reurn the code to tweak the output or feed the output to the next step in the pipeline (discussed in [[Creating a Coding Pipeline]]). Err on the side of saving too much intermediate data rather than not enough intermediate data, though space can become a concern if you are saving too many large data objects (you can use the [[lobstr]] package to see how much memory and R object takes up). You should discuss with your organization's IT how much space is available for you to use. 

For example, save the underlying data that is used to create a [[ggplot]] so that you do not have to rerun code in order to just tweak a plot label, the size of the font, or something similarly small. It is a good practice to separate plotting into separate scripts, where the first script generated the underlying plotting data, and the second script builds the plot. 

R models can be saved with `saveRDS(here("model.rds"))`, though be cautious about the model no longer loading if the package version has changed. For example, if you saved an XGBoost model under XGBoost version 1.3.1, saved it as an `.rds`, and then download XGBoost version `1.3.2`, the model will not work. See [[renv]] for handling package versions. See [[butcher]] for making models take up less storage space.
