We use Argilla [[Argilla Workflows]] as the annotation software.

Here is a generic workflow for annotation based on sentiment analysis of WSJ

1.  Document selection: a. Define the scope of the sentiment classification task, focusing on WSJ articles. b. Collect a diverse and representative set of WSJ articles, considering factors like date, author, section, and topic.
    
2.  Choosing sections of the document to focus on: a. Identify the relevant sections within each WSJ article that contain sentiment information, such as headlines and main body text. b. Exclude sections like author bylines, datelines, or boilerplate text that may not contribute to sentiment analysis.
    
3.  Deciding on annotation schema: a. Determine the sentiment categories for the classification task (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). b. Create clear guidelines for annotators to follow when assigning sentiment labels, including examples and edge cases. c. Choose a suitable annotation tool or platform for your project, preferably one that can handle news articles' formatting and structure.
    
4.  Preannotating with pretrained models: a. Select an appropriate pretrained model for sentiment analysis (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, etc.). b. Fine-tune the pretrained model on a subset of labeled WSJ articles, if available. c. Use the pretrained model to preannotate the collected WSJ articles with sentiment labels.
    
5.  Validating preannotations by several humans: a. Assign multiple annotators to review and edit the preannotations according to the guidelines. b. Ensure that annotators are well-trained and have a good understanding of the guidelines, as well as familiarity with the language and style used in WSJ articles. c. Establish a process for resolving conflicts between annotators, such as using a third annotator or holding discussions.
    
6.  Creating training and test sets: a. Randomly split the annotated WSJ articles into a training set (e.g., 80% of the data) and a test set (e.g., 20% of the data). b. Ensure that the split is representative of the overall distribution of sentiment categories and articles. c. Use stratified sampling if necessary to maintain the proportion of each sentiment category across the training and test sets.
    
7.  Training final models to compare: a. Train several candidate models on the annotated training set, using different architectures, hyperparameters, or feature sets. b. Evaluate the performance of each model on the test set using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, or AUC-ROC. c. Conduct error analysis by examining cases where the models perform poorly, and identify potential areas for improvement, especially in understanding the nuances of sentiment in financial news context. d. Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation results and deploy it for the news sentiment classification task.
    
8.  Iterative refinement: a. Monitor the performance of the deployed model over time and gather user feedback. b. Periodically retrain the model with new, annotated WSJ articles to improve its performance and adapt to changes in the data distribution or sentiment trends. c. Update the guidelines, annotation schema, and training data as needed to address any emerging issues or changes in the sentiment classification task.
