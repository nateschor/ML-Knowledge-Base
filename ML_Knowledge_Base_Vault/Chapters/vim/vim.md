Philosophy behind using an editor (taken from [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/))

> Writing English words and writing code are very different activities. When programming, you spend more time switching files, reading, navigating, and editing code compared to writing a long stream. It makes sense that there are different types of programs for writing English words versus code (e.g. Microsoft Word versus Visual Studio Code).
> 
> As programmers, we spend most of our time editing code, so itâ€™s worth investing time mastering an editor that fits your needs
